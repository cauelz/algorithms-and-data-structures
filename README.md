## What is Data?


Data is commonly understood as symbols representing abstract concepts. For example, consider the letter 'A' in English, which serves both as a symbol in the alphabet and represents a specific sound when spoken. Moreover, these symbols can undergo operations to generate more complex data. This data can then be stored and transmitted, such as to a hard drive, for later use in various operations.

For a more formal definition, one can refer to the definition provided by Google: 

> the quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are
> performed by a computer, being stored and transmitted in the form of
> electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical
> recording media.
